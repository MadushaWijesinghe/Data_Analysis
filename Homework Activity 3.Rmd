##Interpretation

Formula used for the model is IceCreamsales ~ Temperature + Precipitation + (1 | Location), which means modeling the variation in IceCreamsales with a random intercept for each level of the Location grouping variable. 

REML criterion at convergence is 3619.1. Since, this value is large, it does not show the REML criterion is better fit to the data. 

Scaled residuals: 
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-2.56961 -0.65795  0.02701  0.59883  2.55986 

values of scaled residuals lies slightly closer to zero, indicating the moodel fits to data. Most minimun value of the dataset is approximately -2.56961 while the maximum value is 2.55986. Moreover, 25% of residuals are below -0.65795, median is 0.02701 and 75% of residuals are below 0.59883.

The median is close to zero. this indicates that, on average, the models predictions are reasonably close to the observed values.

Random effects:
 Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.
 Location (Intercept)     0      0.0   
 Residual             10636    103.1   
Number of obs: 300, groups:  Location, 3

Randon effects associated with Location and residual variation. Variance betwen diffrent location is 0 and standard deviation is 0.0

Number of oobservations are 300. data is grouped by Location and there are 3 groups.

Fixed effects:
              Estimate Std. Error t value
(Intercept)   1008.721     37.197  27.118
Temperature     19.414      1.262  15.383
Precipitation   -8.867      1.960  -4.523

The estimate of the intercept is 1008.721, and the standard error is 37.197
t-value measures the significance of the estimate. A t-value of 27.118 suggests that the intercept is highly significant.

In summary, the model suggests that there is significant variability in the  IceCreamsales between different temperture and precipitation, as indicated by the random effects associated with location.

The fixed effect intercept of 1008.721 represents the average IceCreamsales across all locations. The model has captured and accounted for the variation in IceCreamsales among locations by including random intercepts.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
